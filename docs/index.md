# ML++ and cppyml

ML++ is a set of efficient C++ implementations of some ML algorithms.

cppyml is a Python extension module built on top of M++. Precompiled cppyml binaries for Windows are available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/cppyml/).

## Contents

- clustering (EM algorithm)
- decision trees for classification and regression
- linear regression (incl. recursive and ridge)

More is coming! See [Doxygen documentation](html/index.html) for the C++ library documentation
and [Sphinx documentation](cppyml/html/index.html) for the Python extensions.

## Requirements

### Windows

Tested with Visual Studio C++ 2019 and Python 3.7.7.

### Linux

Tested with on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (Focal Fossa).
A list of required packages for is in the `ubuntu_required_packages.txt` file.

- SCons >= 4.0.1
- g++ >= 7.5.0
- Python >= 3.6

### C++ dependencies

- pybind11
- benchmark (Google C++ benchmarking library)
- Python 3.x header files
- Eigen++
- (Linux only) pthread


### Python dependencies

For the build:
- setuptools

For demos and tests:
- matplotlib
- nose
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- sklearn
- scipy
- unittest

## Building

### Windows binaries

Use the Visual Studio build process, opening the solution `ML.sln`. Before opening this file, copy the 
provided file `LocalDependencies.props.template` to `LocalDependencies.props` (otherwise the solution won't load).
After loading the solution, adjust the additional include / library paths in this property sheet to point
to the directories where you installed the dependencies (see above).

Pre-built Python extension `cppyml` can be installed via `pip install cppyml` (requires Python 3.7.x).
If you want to build it from source, see [cppyml documentation](cppyml.md).

### Linux binaries

Call `scons` in the main repository directory to build in Debug mode, or `scons mode=release` 
for a Release (optimised) build.

### Doxygen documentation

C++ code has Doxygen-compatible comments. To generate [HTML documentation](html/index.html) from
them, run  in the main repository directory `doxygen Doxyfile` (requires `doxygen` and `graphviz` 
to be installed). The documentation will be written to the `docs/html` subdirectory.

## Python extension

Documentation for the Python extension project `cppyml` is [here](cppyml.md).
